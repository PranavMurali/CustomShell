### The shell features multiple commands such as:
- Wther for weather.
- Cpuinfo for information about your cpu.
- Gpufetch for gpu information.
- Dock-stats to check on your docker containers.
- Remodlled ls command to aid in readability.
- Inbuilt number system converter and integrator, differentiator and simplifier.
- Python-details command to check on the current downloaded versions of python and thier libraries.
- Art for randomly generated ASCII art.
- Also includes most of the UNIX commands and the general unix apt package manager and command usage such as nano, nmap, etc.

### Feel free to use our builds or make a bash executable file ( in the project directory ) to launch the shell in a seperate window with the following line in it:
```bash
xfce4-terminal -H -x go run main.go
```
